# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects using Python. Each project focuses on analyzing different datasets to uncover insights and patterns through visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Titanic Dataset EDA
### Description 
This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of various features to understand the factors that influenced survival rates among passengers.
### Key Insights
- Gender was the primary predictor of survival, with women having a significantly higher survival rate.
- Socioeconomic status played a crucial role; first-class passengers had a much better chance of surviving than those in third class.
- Passengers traveling in small families (2-4 members) had a higher survival rate than those traveling alone or in large families.
- Age also influenced survival, with children having better chances compared to older passengers.
